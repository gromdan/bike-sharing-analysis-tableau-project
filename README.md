# Bike Sharing Analysis in Capital Bikeshare System

## Introduction
Bike-sharing systems offer a modern twist on traditional bike rentals, automating the membership, rental, and return processes. With over 500 schemes globally, these systems are gaining attention for their potential in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues. The data generated by these systems provides unique insights into urban mobility, transforming bike sharing into a virtual sensor network for city dynamics.

## Overview
This project analyzes bike-sharing activities in the Capital Bikeshare system of Washington D.C., USA, for the years 2011 and 2012. We aim to understand how environmental factors and seasonal variations influence bike rental patterns. The analysis is based on a dataset that includes detailed records of bike rentals along with weather and seasonal information, allowing us to visualize key trends and inform strategic decisions for maximizing the system's profitability.

## Data Description
The dataset comprises 17,389 records of hourly and daily bike rental counts along with corresponding weather and seasonal information. Key variables include:
- **Date and Time**: Hourly and daily timestamps.
- **Weather Conditions**: Including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Rental Counts**: Separate counts for casual and registered users.

## Design Methodology
We processed the `hour.csv` dataset for a granular analysis, encoding categorical variables for better visualization and decoding them back for interpretability. This approach facilitated an in-depth understanding of how various factors impact rental behaviors.

## Visualizations
The analysis is illustrated through a series of Tableau visualizations, each providing insights into different aspects of bike rental trends.
